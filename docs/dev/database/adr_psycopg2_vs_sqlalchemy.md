# SQLAlchemy vs psycopg2

Using SQLAlchemy instead of raw psycopg2 provides better scalability, maintainability, and flexibility for several reasons:

## Higher-Level Abstraction

- psycopg2 requires writing raw SQL queries, which can become verbose and error-prone.
- SQLAlchemy ORM lets you interact with the database using Python classes and objects, making the code more readable and modular.

Example: Psycopg2 (Raw SQL)

```sql
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE amount > %s", (10,))
```

Example: SQLAlchemy ORM

```python
session.query(Expense).filter(Expense.amount > 10).all()
```

This is more readable and reusable.

## Scalability: Connection Pooling

- psycopg2 opens and closes connections manually, which can slow down an application under heavy load.
- SQLAlchemy provides connection pooling, reusing connections instead of creating a new one each time.

Example: Connection Pooling in SQLAlchemy

```python
engine = create_engine("postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db", pool_size=10, max_overflow=20)
```

This improves performance in high-traffic applications.

## Migrations with Alembic

- Databases evolve (new tables, modified schemas, etc.).
- psycopg2 requires manually altering tables with raw SQL.
- SQLAlchemy works with Alembic for versioned schema migrations.

Example: Alembic Migration Command

```shell
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Added new column"
alembic upgrade head
```

This makes managing schema changes safer and easier.

## Database Agnosticism

- psycopg2 is PostgreSQL-specific.
- SQLAlchemy supports multiple databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.), making it easier to switch databases if needed.

## Cleaner Code and Maintainability

With SQLAlchemy, database logic stays organized using models.

Example: Psycopg2 (Verbose)

```python
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO expenses (description, amount) VALUES (%s, %s)", ("Lunch", 15))
conn.commit()
```

Example: SQLAlchemy ORM (Cleaner)

```python
session.add(Expense(description="Lunch", amount=15))
session.commit()
```

- The ORM approach makes code more maintainable in large applications.

## When to Use Psycopg2?

- If you only need raw SQL for a simple script or minimal performance overhead.
- If you need very fine-tuned control over queries.

## When to Use SQLAlchemy?

- ✅ If your application will grow (more queries, schema changes).
- ✅ If you want connection pooling for better performance.
- ✅ If you need database migrations.
- ✅ If you might switch to another SQL database in the future.
