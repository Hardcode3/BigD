    Some key benefits of knowing about architectural patterns are as follows:

    - Increased productivity: Instead of reinventing the wheel for each project, architects can rely on established patterns to guide design decisions while saving time and effort. The productivity increase allows teams to focus on the unique aspects of their projects rather than reinventing solutions for recurring issues.

    - Improved code quality: By following standard patterns, developers can produce higher-quality code that is more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.

    - Better communication: Patterns provide a common language and vocabulary making it easy to discuss and communicate design decisions.

    - Faster development cycles: With the help of established patterns, development teams can accelerate their development cycles.
