# Seismic Industry History

!!! tip "Before you get more data, get the most out of your data. (Yilmaz 2001[@Yilmaz2001])"

## Beginning of seismic

Using Meunier (2011) [@meunier2011]:

- First seismoscope was developped by Robert Mallet in 1949.
- Boris Galitzin, a prince of the russian empire, introduced the first electromagnetic seismograph in 1903.
- Karl Zoeppritz described wave behavior at interfaces in 1908.
- Emil Wiechert envisioned refraction prospecting (around 1910).
- Marine acquisitions started to be recognized in the 1950s, a long time after land acquisition methods.

## 1960s - From analog to digital to computers

In the 1960s, the digital revolution profoundly changed seismic acquisition. We were then able to record more data by increasing the number of channels and fold of coverage. The digital revolution brought about the need to use digital computers to analyze the recorded data. That came about in the 1970s when we switched from calculators to computers. Many of the data processing algorithms, including deconvolution, velocity analysis, refraction, and residual statics corrections, normal-moveout corection and stacking, and even migration, were implemented in those years. The computer before the seventies was a person using the calculator; now the computer is a machine and the person became the seismic analyst. (Yilmaz 2001[@Yilmaz2001])

## 1980s - From 2D to 3D

In the 1980s, the seismic industry took another big step forward; it was now beginning to provide the oil and gas industry with 3-D images of the subsurface. We need only to examine the global reserve production curves over the past decades to see that the 3-D revolution gave a big jump from 35 to 45 years for oil and from 50 to 65 years for gas. The seismic industry was already pushing the computer industry to the limit with its need for power to handle large-scale data volumes acquired by 3-D surveys. (Yilmaz 2001[@Yilmaz2001])

## 1990s - From time to depth

Finally, in the 1990s, the seismic industry was capable of providing the oil and gas industry with images of the subsurface, not just in 3-D, but also in depth. It took years of exhaustive experimental research to test and field-prove numerous methods to accurately estimate an earth model in depth and use it to efficiently create an earth image in depth. Once again, the seismic industry has challenged the computer industry to provide cost-effective solutions for numerically intensive applications with large input-output operations, such as 3-D prestack depth migration.

## From 3D to 4D to 4C

 As the seismic industry made one breakthrough after another during its history, it also created new challenges for itself. Now we record not just P-waves but also converted S-waves for a wide range of objectives. Using the multicomponent seismic method, commonly known as the 4-C seismic method, we are now able to see through gas plumes caused by the reservoir below. We are able to sometimes better image the sub-salt and sub-basalt targets with the 4-C seismic method. Using the converted S-waves, we are able to detect the oil-water contact, and the top or base of the reservoir unit that we sometimes could not delineate using only P-waves. We even go further now and attempt to identify fluid types in reservoir rocks, discriminate sand from shale, and map hydrocarbon saturation, again using the 4-C seismic method. Our ultimate objective is to use the seismic method, in addition to the production and geologic data, to characterize oil and gas reservoirs accu- rately. (Yilmaz 2001[@Yilmaz2001])

## From isotropy to anisotropy

Just as we may characterize oil and gas reservoirs seismically, we may also seismically monitor them. Given a set of time-lapse 3-D seismic survey data, which constitutes the basis of the 4-D seismic method, we can track flow paths and fluid distribution in the reservoirs throughout their lifetime. And finally, we have to acknowledge that the earth is anisotropic. By accounting for anisotropy, we can map fractures and increase the accuracy of velocity esitmation and imaging techniques. Accompanying all of these new frontiers for the seismic industry is the availability of a dazzling 3-D visualization technology that now enables us to perform volume-based processing and inversion and interpretation. Keep the following principle in mind when analyzing large volumes of data: before you get more data, get the most out of your data. (Yilmaz 2001[@Yilmaz2001])
