  abstract = { Recently, fast marching methods (FMM) beyond first order have been developed for producing rapid solutions to the eikonal equation. In this paper, we present imaging results for 3‐D prestack Kirchhoff migration using traveltimes computed using the first‐order and second‐order FMM on several 3‐D prestack synthetic and real data sets. The second order traveltimes produce a much better image of the structure. Moreover, insufficiently sampled first order traveltimes can introduce consistent errors in the common reflection point gathers that affect velocity analysis. First‐order traveltimes tend to be smaller than analytic traveltimes, which in turn affects the migration velocity analysis, falsely indicating that the interval velocity was too low. }
